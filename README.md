# MR-Mission5-G1

## Description

The task received was in two stages:

Week 1 - MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

Develop an architecture of a database and a backend server to run in containers, and talk to each other.


Week 2 - MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! All containers are having a tea party!!!

Phase 1: Develop a front-end application based on the prototype design provided by the UX team. 

Phase 2: Containerise the application and establish connections to the backend and database containers.



SELF-DISCLAIMER

A mammoth effort with very a rewarding outcome. Mission accomplished with lots of coffee and determination.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* All contained... in the containers. :B

### Installing

* No installs required as far as I get - containers are for that, right?? *nervous laugh*

### Executing program

* Clone the repository and load it onto your Code Editor
* Navigate to the repository folder
* Run docker-compose up

### Testing

* No unit tests present at this stage

### Errors

* Containers wise fully functional. A few not well-behaved layout items, but nothing major.

## Review

Reviews of any kind will be highly appreciated.
